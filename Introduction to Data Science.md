# Sampling techniques
## Probability
sample chosen using probability method
### Random sampling
equal chance to be chosen as part of sample
### Stratified
every nd record is chosen
(for example every 2nd record is chosen )
### Systematic
1. Stratum is a subset of the population that shares at least one characteristic
2. Random sampling is used to select a sufficient number of subjects from each stratum(equal chance)
## non-Probability
### snowball
### convenience
### judgement
### quota

# type of statictics
## Descriptive statistics
0. Describe data by using summary
1. use s the data to provid edescriptions of the population, either through numerical calculations ro graphs or tables.
2. mainly focus on the main characteristics of data.
3. provide a graphical summary of the data
### Descriptive statistics are broken down into two categories:
1. Measures of Central tendency
2. Measures of Variability(spread)
## Inferential statistics
1. makes inferences and predictions based on a sample 
2. generalizes a large dataset and applies probability to draw a conclusion.
3.  allow us to infer data parameters based on a statistical model using a sample 
## Measure of Centre
Mean
Median
Mode
## Measure of Variability(spread)
Range
Inter Quartile Range
Variance
Standard Deviation
