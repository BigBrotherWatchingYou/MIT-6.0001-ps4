# limits
# Derivatives 
functions that give you the slope of original function of some value
----for example we have funtion f(x) , the derivatives of 
f(x) is f'(x)
function f'(x) will tell me the slope of f(x) at some x value
-------so derivatives is useful for calculating rate of change
# Integration
The oppisite of derivatives
-----for calculating how much accumulate over time
