# How to type math eqotions in markdown
$a \ne 0$
$(ax^2+bx+c = 25)$
$$ x= {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
$b \sqrt 22$
## The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality
$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$

# limits
# Derivatives 
functions that give you the slope of original function of some value
----for example we have funtion f(x) , the derivatives of 
f(x) is f'(x)
function f'(x) will tell me the slope of f(x) at some x value
-------so derivatives is useful for calculating rate of change
# Integration
The oppisite of derivatives
-----for calculating how much accumulate over time
# Antiderivative
When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are 
$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$

$c \ne 0$
