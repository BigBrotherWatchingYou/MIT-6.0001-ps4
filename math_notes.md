# set : {1,2,3}
set could be infinite:{1,2,3,............}
1.repeated elements are listed once
 {a,b,c,c,a} = {a,b,c} 
2. there is no order in sets
{a, b, c} = {c, b, a}

## common sets
Natural Numbers :
N = {0,1,2,3...}(positive integers)

Integers:
Z = {...,-2,-1,0,1,2}

Rational Numbers:
Q = {1/2 ,3/1 , ....}
### implied pattern
imply: includes,indicates
(Socialism implies equality)
so in a setP{1,2,3.....}we call the '.....'is a implied pattern because we don't want to list so much things

### integers:  1 ,2 ,3   
(positive integers: +1, +2 )
(negative integers: -1, -2 ,-3)
decimal: 1.2  ,  1.5 , 1.45

# Elements and Cardinality
cardinality: the number of elements in a set
Set C = {yellow, blue, red}
so its cardinality= 3

∈ is an element of ( belongs to)   a∈b = a belongs to b
'∉ '= is not an element of
∅ = empty set
## U = Union universal set: a set that includes all the items in different set( no repeat)\
### U universal set example: set A = {a,b,c} ,B ={a,d} then AUB the universalset to A and B is {a,b,c,d};
 ## ⋂ = intersection, Venn diagram : elements which are in each intersection and unique to a certain list
 ### for example: n(X U Y )= n(X) + n(Y) - n(X⋂Y) '''all elements are unique'''

n(A) : the cardinality of a set . For exmple A = {1,2,3,4,} then n(A) = 4

A' (or A^c) = the complement of set A, which means the set of elements that are not in A
Example: if A = {1,2,3}, then A' = {4,5,6.....}\
Z = the set of integers like {+-1, +-2,}
Q = the set of rational numbers (those numbers unlike pi=3.1315926.etc)

R = real numbers
⊆ = a subset of
⊂ = a proper subset of

[a,b]= closed interval { a<= x <= b}
(a,b]= the interval {a< x <= b>}
