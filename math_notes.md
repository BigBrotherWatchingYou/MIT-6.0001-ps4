# set : {1,2,3}
set could be infinite:{1,2,3,............}
1.repeated elements are listed once
 {a,b,c,c,a} = {a,b,c} 
2. there is no order in sets
{a, b, c} = {c, b, a}

## common sets
Natural Numbers :
N = {0,1,2,3...}(positive integers)

Integers:
Z = {...,-2,-1,0,1,2}

Rational Numbers:
Q = {1/2 ,3/1 , ....}
### implied pattern
imply: includes,indicates
(Socialism implies equality)
so in a setP{1,2,3.....}we call the '.....'is a implied pattern because we don't want to list so much things

### integers:  1 ,2 ,3   
(positive integers: +1, +2 )
(negative integers: -1, -2 ,-3)
decimal: 1.2  ,  1.5 , 1.45
